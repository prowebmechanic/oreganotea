This is a basic note taking app and simple Project Manager.

Think of it as Post-It Notes or in this case, Oregano téa bags.
Each Note in the Project Files box can be a tea bag.

You add copy, code notes, images, etc. in the Project Files window.
Then add little notes and reminders on the Calendar ~ That Simple!

Use the ToDo List to have overall permanent Goals or ToDo's to keep focused on.

Use the Save Note as HTML to send to coworkers or participants.
